Create new pages by clicking the **Add child page** button. This creates a child page of the section you are currently in. In this case a child page of the 'School of Fine Art' page.

Note that **News items** and **Events** are pages as well and only allowed to be created as child pages of an **NewsIndex Page** or **EventIndex Page** respectively.
