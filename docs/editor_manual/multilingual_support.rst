Multilingual Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All pages support translation. The current language can be changed by selecting the appropriate language in the dropdown.
Site urls prepending the url with either ``/en/`` or ``/de/`` will always link to the appropriate version.

Translation
___________

* Fields that support translation will appear once for every language in the page editor and will be marked as such.
* When missing a german translation, the english version will be used instead. When missing an english version, the field will remain empty.
* Multilingual fields provide a button on the right that replaces its content with the content of the transalted field.
