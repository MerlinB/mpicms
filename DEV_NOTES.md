# Translation
In `urls.py`, `i18n_patterns()` can be passed `prefix_default_language=False`. This disables the language url prefix for the default language, but results in breaking Django's `set_language` view (used by language selection dropdown), as it is not able to get the current url without language prefix. This could be solved by passing the redirect location as POST parameter `next`, and would require to write a hacky solution to remove the language prefix, if it exists.
